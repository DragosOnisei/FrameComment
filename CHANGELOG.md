## [Unreleased]

Planned for upcoming releases. See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DragosOnisei/FrameComment/issues)
and [Discussions](https://github.com/DragosOnisei/FrameComment/discussions) for the live roadmap.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- **Edit your own comments and replies.** A pencil "Edit" button now appears
  next to each comment for the original author and for admins. The new
  endpoint is `PATCH /api/comments/[id]`. Authorization is enforced via a
  per-share-session id (admins can override).
- **Voice messages on comments.** A new microphone icon next to the
  attachment paperclip records audio (up to 5 minutes) and attaches it to
  the comment. Includes a live waveform during recording, an inline audio
  player on saved comments, and a microphone-device picker for users with
  multiple inputs.
- **New annotation shapes — arrow, line, rectangle.** The comment drawing
  tools used to be freehand-only; you can now drop arrows, straight lines,
  and rectangles on top of any frame. Arrows scale with drag length so a
  short arrow stays delicate and a long arrow gets visibly thicker.
- **Inline annotation toolbar.** The drawing toolbar is now rendered inside
  the comment input row (Frame.io-style), so picking a tool/colour and
  reviewing your sketch happens without leaving the comment area. The video
  is no longer dimmed while drawing.
- **Single back arrow replaces the old Cancel/Done pair.** Pressing back
  commits the drawing if any shapes exist, otherwise cancels. Pressing
  Send (or Enter) while drawing now auto-commits the drawing first, so you
  can post in one click without a separate finish step.
- **Click-to-pin annotation.** Clicking a comment in the sidebar surfaces
  its drawing on the video and seeks to its timecode. Drawings stay strictly
  bound to their comment's timecode — they appear when the playhead reaches
  the frame and disappear once it moves on.
- **Image attachments render as previews + click-to-zoom lightbox.** Image
  files attached to comments now show as a small grid of thumbnails inline.
  Clicking a thumbnail opens a full-screen lightbox; Esc / outside-click
  closes it. Non-image attachments keep the existing download row.
- **Submit without text.** Comments containing only an attachment, voice
  message, or annotation can now be posted with an empty text body. We no
  longer auto-fill placeholder text such as `Attachments uploaded #1` or
  `Drawing annotation`.
- **Annotation colour palette restricted to 3.** The toolbar now offers
  red / orange / green only, mapped to a clearer shared meaning across
  reviewers (problem / note / approved). Existing annotations with other
  colours continue to render correctly.
- **Cmd+Z / Cmd+Shift+Z redo support.** The drawing surface now keeps both
  an undo and a redo stack, with the standard keyboard shortcuts.

### Changed

- **Localisation reduced to English.** Dutch (`nl`) and German (`de`)
  translation bundles have been removed. The single-language language
  switcher is hidden automatically when only one locale is available.
- **`Permissions-Policy` allows microphone for the comment recorder.**
  Camera and geolocation remain disabled.
- **Stricter annotation render gating.** Drawings on saved comments only
  render while the playhead is inside the comment's timecode window.
  Pending (just-drawn) drawings render on a slightly more generous window
  while the user is still composing their comment.

### Fixed

- **Annotations were silently dropped server-side.** The validation schema
  for `Comment.annotations` only accepted the legacy `freehand` shape; the
  new `arrow`, `line` and `rectangle` shapes were stripped during request
  parsing and never persisted. Schema is now a discriminated union over
  all four shape types.
- **`audio/webm` was rejected by the asset uploader.** Browser voice
  recordings produce `audio/webm` (Chrome/Firefox) or `audio/mp4` (Safari);
  both are now allowed extensions and MIME types.
- **PostgreSQL 18 fresh-install error revisited.** Already pinned in 1.0.1
  for the project compose files; the TrueNAS catalog template now also
  pins `PGDATA` to `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.

### Improved (developer experience only — no production impact)

- New `npm run worker:dev` is registered as a script alias.
- Added a configurable preview-LUT path via `PREVIEW_LUT_PATH` for local
  development outside Docker.
- Inline TUS auth header added to the voice recorder upload path so it
  authenticates the same way attachment uploads do.

### Internal

- New `editorSessionId` column on `Comment` (Prisma migration
  `20260504184125_add_comment_editor_session_id`). Stores the share-token
  session id of the original author so they can edit their own comment
  later from the same browser.
- New `AnnotationProvider` React context wraps the share and admin share
  pages. Drawing state, mode, and pending-annotation lifecycle are now
  shared between `VideoPlayer` and `CommentInput` via context instead of
  window events alone.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-05-04

### Removed

- **Client-facing onboarding tutorial.** New share links no longer trigger a
  `driver.js`-based "Welcome / This page lets you watch videos…" walkthrough
  for clients. The `<ShareTutorial>` component is no longer rendered on the
  public share page, and the per-project default for `showClientTutorial` has
  been flipped from `true` to `false` for newly created projects.

### Fixed

- **Postgres 18 fresh-install failure.** Postgres 18 changed its default data
  directory layout (`PGDATA` now points at `/var/lib/postgresql/<major>/docker`
  instead of `/var/lib/postgresql/data`), which made fresh installs against an
  empty `/var/lib/postgresql/data` mount fail with *"unused mount/volume"*. We
  now pin `PGDATA` to the legacy path in `docker-compose.yml`,
  `docker-compose.truenas.yml`, `docker-compose.unraid.yml`, and the TrueNAS
  catalog template. Existing 1.0.0 installs are unaffected.

### Improved (developer experience only — no production impact)

- **`npm run worker:dev`** new script that loads `.env` (or `.env.local`) before
  starting the worker, so local-dev runs of the worker pick up `STORAGE_ROOT`,
  `DATABASE_URL`, etc. without manual env exports.
- **CSP relaxed in development mode** — `'unsafe-eval'` and `'unsafe-inline'`
  are added in dev so React Refresh / Turbopack work without console errors.
  Production CSP is unchanged (strict nonce-based policy).
- **`PREVIEW_LUT_PATH` env var** — overrides the hard-coded `/usr/share/ffmpeg/previewlut.cube`
  so the worker can find the LUT file when running natively on a developer's
  machine. Default unchanged in Docker.
- **`docs/DEV-LOCAL.md`** added with a step-by-step local-development guide.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-02

### Initial release

FrameComment 1.0.0 is the inaugural release of this project. It is a friendly
fork of [ViTransfer 1.0.2](https://github.com/MansiVisuals/ViTransfer) by
[MansiVisuals](https://github.com/MansiVisuals), licensed under AGPL-3.0-only.
All upstream functionality is preserved; the project has been rebranded and
re-packaged for independent distribution and a new release cycle.

### Changed

- **Project rename** — every occurrence of `ViTransfer` / `vitransfer` /
  `VITRANSFER` has been replaced with `FrameComment` / `framecomment` /
  `FRAMECOMMENT` across source, configuration, documentation, translations
  (en, nl, de), Docker / Quadlet manifests, GitHub Actions workflows, and the
  PWA manifest.
- **Docker image** — the published image moves from `mansivisuals/vitransfer`
  (and the older `crypt010/vitransfer`) to `dragosonisei/framecomment`.
- **Repository home** — the canonical source repository is now
  `https://github.com/DragosOnisei/FrameComment`.
- **Author / maintainer metadata** in `package.json` updated to Dragos Onisei
  &lt;dragosonisei@gmail.com&gt;. License remains AGPL-3.0-only.
- **Quadlet unit files** renamed from `vitransfer-*.{container,network}` to
  `framecomment-*.{container,network}`.

### Added

- **Attribution** — a `NOTICE` file documenting the upstream attribution and
  AGPL-3.0 obligations, plus a "Credits & Attribution" section in the README
  and a discreet upstream link in the in-app footer.
- **TrueNAS SCALE app catalog skeleton** — `truenas-catalog/framecomment/`
  containing the chart layout (`app.yaml`, `questions.yaml`, `templates/`,
  `metadata.yaml`, `README.md`) so FrameComment can be installed via a custom
  TrueNAS SCALE catalog while we work toward a fully polished chart in 1.1.x.
- **Release tooling** — `docs/RELEASING.md` with a documented SemVer + GitHub
  Releases flow, plus a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a multi-arch
  Docker image and publishes a GitHub Release on tag push (`v*`).

### Removed

- Donation / sponsorship links to the upstream author have been removed from
  the README, in-app footer, and wiki. (The legal AGPL-3.0 attribution to
  MansiVisuals is preserved.)

### Notes for users coming from ViTransfer

- The application schema, environment variables, and HTTP routes are
  unchanged in 1.0.0; an existing ViTransfer install can be migrated by
  swapping the Docker image and updating `container_name` references.
- The configuration variable prefixes (e.g. database name defaults, network
  names) have been renamed; review `docker-compose.yml` and your `.env`
  before upgrading. Detailed migration notes will be added in 1.0.1.
