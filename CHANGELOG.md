## [Unreleased]

Planned for upcoming releases. See [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DragosOnisei/FrameComment/issues)
and [Discussions](https://github.com/DragosOnisei/FrameComment/discussions) for the live roadmap.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-02

### Initial release

FrameComment 1.0.0 is the inaugural release of this project. It is a friendly
fork of [ViTransfer 1.0.2](https://github.com/MansiVisuals/ViTransfer) by
[MansiVisuals](https://github.com/MansiVisuals), licensed under AGPL-3.0-only.
All upstream functionality is preserved; the project has been rebranded and
re-packaged for independent distribution and a new release cycle.

### Changed

- **Project rename** — every occurrence of `ViTransfer` / `vitransfer` /
  `VITRANSFER` has been replaced with `FrameComment` / `framecomment` /
  `FRAMECOMMENT` across source, configuration, documentation, translations
  (en, nl, de), Docker / Quadlet manifests, GitHub Actions workflows, and the
  PWA manifest.
- **Docker image** — the published image moves from `mansivisuals/vitransfer`
  (and the older `crypt010/vitransfer`) to `dragosonisei/framecomment`.
- **Repository home** — the canonical source repository is now
  `https://github.com/DragosOnisei/FrameComment`.
- **Author / maintainer metadata** in `package.json` updated to Dragos Onisei
  &lt;dragosonisei@gmail.com&gt;. License remains AGPL-3.0-only.
- **Quadlet unit files** renamed from `vitransfer-*.{container,network}` to
  `framecomment-*.{container,network}`.

### Added

- **Attribution** — a `NOTICE` file documenting the upstream attribution and
  AGPL-3.0 obligations, plus a "Credits & Attribution" section in the README
  and a discreet upstream link in the in-app footer.
- **TrueNAS SCALE app catalog skeleton** — `truenas-catalog/framecomment/`
  containing the chart layout (`app.yaml`, `questions.yaml`, `templates/`,
  `metadata.yaml`, `README.md`) so FrameComment can be installed via a custom
  TrueNAS SCALE catalog while we work toward a fully polished chart in 1.1.x.
- **Release tooling** — `docs/RELEASING.md` with a documented SemVer + GitHub
  Releases flow, plus a GitHub Actions workflow that builds a multi-arch
  Docker image and publishes a GitHub Release on tag push (`v*`).

### Removed

- Donation / sponsorship links to the upstream author have been removed from
  the README, in-app footer, and wiki. (The legal AGPL-3.0 attribution to
  MansiVisuals is preserved.)

### Notes for users coming from ViTransfer

- The application schema, environment variables, and HTTP routes are
  unchanged in 1.0.0; an existing ViTransfer install can be migrated by
  swapping the Docker image and updating `container_name` references.
- The configuration variable prefixes (e.g. database name defaults, network
  names) have been renamed; review `docker-compose.yml` and your `.env`
  before upgrading. Detailed migration notes will be added in 1.0.1.
